## What even is this project?

This is to become a Magic: the Gathering deck viewer/editor/thing utilizing Scryfall API to fetch up data such as card images, printings, prices, all that jazz. Because I have no previous experience in UI design or web-based coding (as in fetching things), this is also a learning experience for me. Watch out, companies, I'm here to show what a hobbyist coder can do! (please do not abandon this project after two days, it deserves better and so do you)

TO-DO:
1. store decklists (card names and quantities) in .txt format
2. create a visual UI
3. associate correct images with cards (from Scryfall, most likely)
4. find the cards' respective pricings
5. idk, make it look pretty
